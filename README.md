This is a component of the rpath_common set of modules.  It provides
a stable interface for reading and writing rPath-generated XML
files.

Note that all documentation regarding stable interfaces is relevant
only to published stable releases; it is not in force for alpha
and beta releases, including 0.x releases and any automated builds.

To use the latest version of the interface:
    import rpath_xmllib
To use a specific API version of the interface:
    from rpath_xmllib import api1 as xmllib

API documentation is available at http://cvs.rpath.com/rpath-xmllib-docs/
or by running "make html" and viewing docs/developer/index.html (requires
epydoc).
